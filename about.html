    <h1>History of 1932 angaaray and 2024 angaray book magzine</h1>
    <h3>Angarey or Angaaray (translated alternatively as "Embers" or "Burning Coals") is a collection of nine short
        stories and a one act play in Urdu by Sajjad Zaheer, Rashid Jahan, Mahmud-uz-Zafar and Ahmed Ali first published
        in 1932 and generally considered to have marked the beginning of the Progressive Writers' Movement in Indian
        literature. The release of the book was marked by protests and it was subsequently banned by the government of
        the United Provinces a few months after publication.

    <h1>Themes</h1>
    <h3>Sajjad Zaheer, Rashid Jahan, Ali Ahmed and Mahmud-uz-Zafar were all educated in Oxford and were heavily inspired
        by the writings of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence and in some cases from Marxist writings. They
        were not only critical of conservative elements within the Muslim community but also of the corrosive effects of
        British imperial rule in India.[2] The stories of Zaheer related enslavement to social and religious practice
        based on ignorance. They protested against the prevailing social, religious and political institutions and the
        economic inequality of the society.[4] Zaheer's stories also dealt with sexual desire and sexual repression and
        highlighted the ways that religious and social restrictions unnecessarily damage the human psyche.[5] The
        stories of Rashid Jahan dealt with oppressive worlds of Muslim women and the outdated religious and social dogma
        their societies. [6][4] Ali's stories delved primarily on the condition of women like poverty, domestic abuse,
        sexual desire and longing experienced by widows.</h3>
    <h1>Controversy</h1>
    <h2>Reciptent</h2>
    <h3>Angaray was first published in December 1932 by the Nizami Press, Lucknow.[7] The book created controversy in
        the Muslim community of the British India upon its release and was met with outrage from both the religious and
        civil authorities. Newspapers and journals wrote angry editorials denouncing the book. Hindustan times carried
        an article ‘Urdu Pamphlet Denounced: Shias Gravely Upset' quoting a resolution passed by the All India Shia
        Conference Lucknow condemning the publication of the book.[4] Agitations were held in Lucknow and Aligarh and
        the copies of the book were burnt in public.[8] The book was reviewed by scholars and critics like Akhtar
        Hussain Raipuri, Munshi Daya Narain Nigam and Muhammad Mujib of Jamia Millia Islamia who wrote detail critique
        on the book</h3>
    <h1>Ban</h1>
    <h3>Four months after publication, on 15 March 1933, the book was banned by the government of the United Provinces
        under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code. All but five copies were destroyed by the police, two of which were
        sent to British Library’s Oriental and India Office Collections. [1]

        However, even after Angarey was proscribed, the four authors refused to apologize for it. On 5 April 1933,
        Mahmud-uz-Zafar wrote an article, ‘In Defence of Angarey’ for The Leader, a newspaper published from Allahabad.
        [9][8]The piece was also reproduced in some other papers, including the Hindustan Times. Subtitled ‘Shall We
        Submit to Gagging?’ it read:

        The authors of this book do not wish to make any apology for it. They leave it to float or sink of itself. They
        are not afraid of the consequences of having launched it. They only wish to defend 'the right of launching it
        and all other vessels like it' ... they stand for the right of free criticism and free expression in all matters
        of the highest importance to the human race in general and the Indian people in particular... Whatever happen to
        the book or to the authors, we hope that others will not be discouraged. Our practical proposal is the formation
        immediately of a League of Progressive Authors, which should bring forth similar collections from time to time
        both in English and the various vernaculars of our country. We appeal to all those who are interested in this
        idea to get in touch with us.[4]</h3>
